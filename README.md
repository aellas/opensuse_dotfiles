# <p align=center> openSUSE Tumbleweed + Hyprland dotfiles </p>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The install script does not place any of the files for you, I've done this so you can decide which parts of my dotfiles you want :) 

## Install script
```
cd /path/to/script
chmod +x setup-suse.sh
./setup-suse.sh
```
After the script has finished, install tofi via `opi tofi`
